# Algorithms and Data Structures

## Description
This repository contains lab work completed during the **Algorithm and Data Structures** subject. The labs cover a wide range of topics including binary representation, sorting and searching algorithms, data structures like lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. The goal of these labs was to deepen understanding of core algorithms and data structures and their practical implementations.

## Lab Works

### Lab Work 1: Built-in Data Structures
- **Task 1:** Develop and debug a program that outputs a binary representation of the given values.
- **Task 2:** Develop and debug a program that determines the value of a variable based on its binary representation.

### Lab Work 2: Derived Data Structures (Strings)
- **Task:** Output the string `s` to the monitor screen.

### Lab Work 3: Comparative Analysis of Sorting Methods
- **Task:** Implement and compare different array sorting methods. Conduct experiments to measure the time characteristics of sorting algorithms.

### Lab Work 4: Comparative Analysis of Search Algorithms
- **Task:** Develop and implement a tool to experiment with and determine the time characteristics of search algorithms.

### Lab Work 5: Linear List Data Structures
- **Task 1:** Implement a dynamic array to store the elements of a linear list. Memory for the array is dynamically allocated during initialization, and the number of elements is stored in a descriptor.
- **Task 2:** Represent a polynomial `P(x)` with integer coefficients as a list. The polynomial takes the form `anx^n + an-1x^(n-1) + ... + a1x + a0`, and terms with zero coefficients are excluded from the list. Define a function `EQUAL(p, q)` to check if polynomials `p` and `q` are equal.

### Lab Work 6: Stack and Queue Data Structures
- **Task:** Develop a program simulating a computing system with discrete time steps. The system contains queues, stacks, and processors, and each object (queue, stack, processor) has tasks with assigned time values. The simulation time, tasks, and objects are presented in tabular form.

### Lab Work 7: Tree Data Structures
- **Task:** The elements of a tree are stored in the `MemTree` array in static memory. The base type of elements is arbitrary. The "free" elements are linked into a list, with the start of the list indicated by the right child of the first element in the array. Multiple trees can be stored in this array.

### Lab Work 8: Table Data Structures
- **Task:** A text file contains Russian text, which may include numbers written in words. Convert the file by replacing the word representation of numbers with their numerical representation.
